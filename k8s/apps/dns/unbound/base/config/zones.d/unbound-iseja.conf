    # then ignored. Can be given multiple times to specify multiple domains
    # that are treated as if unsigned. If you set trust anchors for the
    # domain they override this setting (and the domain is secured).
    #
    # This can be useful if you want to make sure a trust anchor for
    # external lookups does not affect an (unsigned) internal domain. A DS
    # record externally can create validation failures for that internal
    # domain.

    # wish to serve such zone you can unblock them by uncommenting one
    # of the nodefault statements below.
    # You may also have to use domain-insecure: zone to make DNSSEC work,

# The stub zone can be used to configure authoritative data to be used by the
# resolver that cannot be accessed using the public internet servers. This is
# useful for company-local data or private zones.
#
# Consider adding server: statements for `domain-insecure:` and `local-zone:
# <name> nodefault` for the zone if it is a locally served zone. The insecure
# clause stops DNSSEC from invalidating the zone. The local-zone: nodefault (or
# transparent) clause makes the (reverse-) zone bypass Unboundâ€™s filtering of
# RFC 1918 zones.
